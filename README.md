# Line-Following-Robot-With-Obstacles-Detection

Robot is a machine that can carry out complex series of actions automatically when once programmed by computer. 
There are five types of robots which are Pre-Programmed Robots, Humanoid Robots, Autonomous Robots, Tele operated Robots and Augmenting Robots. 
Autonomous robots are intelligent robots capable of performing tasks in the world by themselves, without explicit human control. 
Line following robot with obstacle detection is a type of autonomous robot that follows defined path by detecting nearby obstacle. In the project design line following robot with obstacle detection using IR and ultrasonic sensors integrated with Arduino microcontroller. 
IR sensor used to detect the path drawn in the floor and the ultrasonic sensor used to detect the obstacle. 
Also add buzzer for alarm system to notify when the obstacle is present. 
For circuit simulation we use Proteus Design Suite integrated with Arduino program to observe the overall circuit of the thesis. 
Webots software also is used for visual simulation using e-puck Webots library. 
The obstacles and the patch designed using Webots and itâ€™s clearly visible in the simulation.
